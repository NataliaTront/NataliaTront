# PORTFOLIO

Hi! My name is Natalia Tront. I'm 33 years old Polish woman and I want to change my career path to software tester.

For a few years I was working as an office assistant. An employment break helped me realize that it isn't a job I want to do in the future. So I start searching.
When I found information about software tasting something "click" in my mind :) I remembered how I loved proofreading, searching for mistakes and inaccuracy when I was younger and how I gave up to do it professionally because of non-future profession and low salary.

Reading about software testing, I think it is a job that can combine my passion for finding bugs and my job expectations.

I start learning and I hope to find my dream job. Here you can see my way to becoming a software tester.

## Little more about me
I'm a person with a lot of different skills, knowledge and interests. I'm a Master of Education in Polish Philology but also a Technician of Business Administration with Finance and Accounting specialization. Since my teenage years I was writing my own fiction, after a few hard reviews I realize that first I must learn how to write. Then I discover proofreading and it became my hobby for many years. It improved my `perception` of finding mistakes and `logical thinking`.

When I was a student I got a job as an office assistant. The most important thing I was doing there was preparing tender offers. That learned me `accuracy`, `keeping deadlines` and `writing official documents` - skills which I think are very important in testing.

After a few years I became a mom and start an employment brake. But it wasn't lazy time! I start my own little "business" - sewing wool diapers as [Hearties](https://www.facebook.com/Hearties/). I needed to learn everything about production, Internet selling and contact with clients. It required me to `prioritize`, `self-denial` and `responsibility`.

I decide to return a full-time job but it didn't take a long time because I had health problems and needed an operation. That's the moment when I start thinking about changing my profession. I'm healthy now ;)

I think that my past experience gave me strong soft skills for software testing.
